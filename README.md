About The App

To-do app is an app that allows you to make a to-do list, for example as a shopping list. You can cross of or delete tasks from your list or you can select view all, view undone, view done or delete all tasks. The page asks for your name and the next time you open the page a prompt will appear asking 'hey (savedName) would you like to return to page?' and then you have the option to start over or just return to the page.

Setup

Credits

Chatgpt and microsoft copilot aided me by giving advice on my code that wasn't functioning properly. I find that long files will be tedious to look through yourself so I prefer to give them a chance.
They also gave me ideas on colours used on the page.
